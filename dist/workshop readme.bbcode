A custom game for putting together jigsaw puzzles with friends and family!

Unlike Tabletop's built-in jigsaw mode, pieces stick to each other when placed correctly allowing for a better, more natural puzzle-solving experience.

This version of Jigsaw Join includes adaptations more suitable for friends and family environments, plus tons of improvements and QoL features!
