#   Creates an extruded 3D model of a 2D polygon in Wavefront OBJ format as a string, with the 2D X/Y coordinates
# becoming 3D X/Z coordinates with extrusion along the Y axis, and a picture texture-mapped to only the top (+Y) face.
# Faces with up to face_max_verts are used, e.g. 4 to use only tris and quads.
#   The input polygon (list of vertices) may be clockwise or counterclockwise, as it will be flipped as needed. And it
# need not be convex. But it must be a single non-self-intersecting polygon. Vertex/picture coords are in the screen
# convention (+X right, +Y down).
#   To reduce the size of the obj file, numbers are written without leading/trailing 0's or a trailing decimal point,
# except as necessary (e.g. '.01', '.1', '1', '10', '0', '-.1') and single-char newlines are used (but it's up to the
# caller to prevent Python from converting to e.g. Windows-style newlines when writing the file).
#   All parameters are in terms of the unscaled vertex coords. The obj coords will be rounded to the minimum number of
# decimal places required to avoid more absolute rounding error than the respective parameter. The plane scaling is
# performed only in the X and Z directions (corresponding to the original X and Y), as the thickness arguments control
# the Y extrusion direction, and max_vertex_1d_error refers to the original (vertex) coords. The picture will be
# texture- mapped such that obj texture coords (0, 1) and (1, 0) correspond to picture_rect[0] and picture_rect[1]
# respectively, and max_texture_1d_error refers to the original (picture) coords. Note that the errors are only
# considered per axis independently, so the actual multi-dimensional error can be a bit greater.
#   To avoid tiny gaps between neighboring objects caused by rounding errors (particularly when objects are rotated by
# other than a multiple of 90 deg), the offset parameter can be set to some small value to extend the polygon away from
# each of its line segments so the objects overlap slightly. The offset should be set to at least max_vertex_1d_error *
# sqrt(2) to cover the worst 2D error.
#   Rounding examples:
#     * If plane_scale=1 and max_vertex_1d_error=0.005, then up to 2 decimal places will be output for vertex coords.
#     * If plane_scale=20 and max_vertex_1d_error=0.0025, then up to 1 decimal place will be output for vertex coords,
#       because rounding the final output to 1 decimal place has a max error of 0.05 in the final scaled coords,
#       corresponding to 0.0025 error in the original coords.
#     * If plane_scale=1 and max_vertex_1d_error=0.0049, then up to 3 decimal places will be output for vertex coords.
#     * If picture_rect=((-16,-9),(16,9)) and max_texture_1d_error=0.01, then up to 4 decimal places will be output
#       for the U coord and up to 3 decimal places for the V coord, because 4 and 3 decimal places on a 0-1 scale
#       correspond to errors of 0.00005*(16+16)=0.0016 and 0.0005*(9+9)=0.009 respectively in the original coords.
